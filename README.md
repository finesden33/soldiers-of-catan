# soldiers-of-catan
I had a phase where I was an avid Catan player (if you don't know what it is, it's a fun board game: https://www.catan.com), during which I came up with my own board game that uses a Catan board to play it.
I called the game "Soldiers of Catan" since Catan was originally called "Settlers of Catan", and my game is kind of like a blend of Risk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) and Catan.
